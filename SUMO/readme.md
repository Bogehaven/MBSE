SUMO simulation setup for Ã˜sterbro

### How to open
Open `osm.sumocfg` in the SUMO GUI app

### Files
- `osm.vehicle.types.xml`: Contains vehicle definitions
- `osm.passenger.trips.xml`: Contains the routes and vehicle types for passenger cars
- `osm.truck.trips.xml`: Contains the routes and vehicle types for trucks
- `vehicle_dist.py`: Script for changing the distribution of vehicle types for a group of vehicles

### How to run vehicle distribution script

**Dependencies:**
- Beautifulsoup4
- lxml

Run it from command line: `python vehicle_dist.py '<filename>' '<dictionary_containing_probabilities>'`

For example:  `python vehicle_dist.py 'osm.passenger.trip.xml' '{"gas": 0.6, "hybrid": 0.3, "ev": 0.1}'`
